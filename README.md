Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?.
The client wanted me to create a program that would host their game on a web service, the game existed as an Andriod only game prior.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
The part of this project I feel I did the best creating code that was easily readable and well documented.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
Learning to use our IDE's to create documentation automatically was increadibly helpful.

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
I would redo how we host it to begin with, I do not like the dependencies used that our teacher gave us.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
I implemented exactly what the uesr said at each step, they are important to consider as that is what they are paying us for.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
I approach it from the mindset of someone trying to learn as much as I can about solving the problem created in order to create the best product.
